This bot is more of a learning exercise than anything else, however if it can help to cut down on the Daily Mails ad revenue then all the better!

To intsall this bot you need

    pip install praw pyimgur selenium Pillow xvfbwrapper
    
And the program xvfb, you can probably find it in your distributions repo's. You also need firefox installed to help get the screenshot!
